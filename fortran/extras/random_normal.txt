To set the seed you need call random_seed(put=seed) where seed is a rank 1 array of size at least n where n - again processor-dependent - is given by call random_seed(size=n). From your call i holds this value. See 13.7.136 of F2008.

A common way is:
integer, allocatable :: seed(:) integer size call random_seed(size=size) allocate(seed(size)) ! set seed(:) somehow call random_seed(put=seed) 

Use of srand() is non-standard.
